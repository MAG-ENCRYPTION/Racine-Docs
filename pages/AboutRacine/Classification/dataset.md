---

Please note that all datasets share the same column structure, which includes various packet and byte-related features, as well as the traffic type. These features provide valuable information for classifying the network traffic into different service categories.

The classification process involves analyzing the traffic type column and assigning each dataset entry to one of the following service categories:

- Real-time: Represents traffic that requires immediate transmission, such as voice or video streaming.
- Shared-time: Refers to traffic that shares resources with other services, typically characterized by medium-priority traffic.
- Dedicated: Denotes traffic that has dedicated resources and high-priority transmission.

By examining the traffic type column, the RACINE project can classify the datasets (e.g., CSA, CSI, PING, etc.) into the respective service categories, enabling further analysis and network optimization.

In this summary table, we compared the dataset files based on their number of rows, number of columns, file size, and different selection criteria. Each file was evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Accuracy: Evaluates the model's ability to accurately predict the traffic type.
- Speed: Measures the execution speed of the model for classification.
- Stability: Indicates the stability and consistency of the classification results.
- Availability: Evaluates the availability of data and its representativeness for classification.
- Reliability: Measures the reliability of the data and its ability to provide consistent results.
- Efficiency: Evaluates the efficiency of the model in quickly classifying the data.
- Quality: Indicates the overall quality of the dataset file in terms of data representativeness and reliability.

Based on these criteria, the best dataset file may vary depending on the specific requirements of the project. Therefore, please choose the file that best aligns with your objectives and relevant criteria for your use case.
